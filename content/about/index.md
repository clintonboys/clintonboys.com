# About me

Hey there, I'm Clinton. I am an Australian mathematician and software engineer living in London (formerly Tel Aviv, and before that, Sydney). You can visit my [now]({{< ref "now" >}}) page to see what I'm up to and what's on my mind at the moment: I try to keep it up to date. 

I like hacking away at interesting problems in lots of different areas: mathematics, statistics, programming, data and data science, elections and electoral systems, and many more. I am a keen writer and an amateur musician and photographer: all the photographs across this website were taken by me. 

## Work and skills

I graduated from the University of Sydney in 2011 with a First Class Honours degree in Pure Mathematics, and then in 2015 with a PhD in Mathematics. You can find answers to some frequently asked questions about my PhD [here]({{< ref "projects/phd" >}}).

In 2015 I moved from Sydney to Tel Aviv and worked there for eight years at various startups, ending up at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com). In 2023 I relocated with Via to London with my family. 

After my move to working in technology, I initially called myself a data scientist, but over the years I have become more and more of an [all-rounder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder), incorporating software engineering, algorithm development and a lot of other tools into my toolkit. If you're interested in more details, you can find my resume here. My [blog]({{< ref "posts" >}}) also contains a long history of posts about things I have been interested in over the years. 

If you'd like to know more about the tools I use to get things done, you can find my answers to the [usesthis](http://usesthis.com) questionnaire [here]({{< ref "posts/uses-this-2025" >}}). You can also explore my [digital garden](http://mtsolitary.com).
