Welcome to the personal website of Clinton Boys. I am an Australian mathematician and programmer living and working in London.

If this is your first time visiting my site, you might want to start with my [about]({{< ref "about" >}}) page for some more details about who I am and what I do, or my [now]({{< ref "now" >}}) page to see what I’m up to and what’s on my mind at the moment. My [blog]({{< ref "posts" >}}) contains posts about mathematics, programming and computer science, elections, technology and some of my other interests.
