# nitzanboys.com

*March 10, 2024*

My [wife](https://www.nitzanboys.com/) is an independent psychotherapist who needed a landing page for prospective clients. Since her requirements were quite straightforward, I figured this was a good use case for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator I used to build my own [digital garden](https://mtsolitary.com) site a couple of years ago (see [here]({{< ref "projects/mt-solitary" >}}) for a full write up about that project). 

Apart from the obvious requirement of displaying text and images in a simple and aesthetically pleasing way, there were a couple of additional requirements:

- Support for multiple languages. Since my wife accepts clients in English or Hebrew, it was important to be able to support internationalisation easily, and to effortlessly switch between the two languages. 
- Fast to load and responsive. 
- Automatically support mobile and desktop formats, because who actually uses a computer anymore? 
- Support for simple, privacy-aware analytics (I use [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), which is open-source and privacy focussed, on my other sites, so that was my first choice). 

Thankfully I found the great [ToHa](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/toha/) theme for Hugo which easily supported all of these requirements. The great thing about Hugo and its themes being open source is you can just fork the theme you want and make whichever customisations you like until the site looks exactly how you want it. It only took a couple of days of fiddling to get the site looking exactly how my wife wanted it!
