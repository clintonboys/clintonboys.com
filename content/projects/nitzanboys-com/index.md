*March 10, 2024*

My wife is an independent psychotherapist who needed a landing page for prospective clients. Since her requirements were quite straightforward, I figured this was a good use case for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator I used to build my own [digital garden](https://mtsolitary.com) site a couple of years ago (see [here]({{< ref "projects/mt-solitary" >}}) for a full write up about that project).
