# Angophora

*March 30, 2025*

[Angophora](https://angophora-blog.vercel.app) is a new blog I started this week to share some writing that doesn't naturally fit on this technically-slanted personal website, or on my "digital garden" [Mt. Solitary](https://mtsolitary.com/). I'm hoping to post things at quite a regular cadence here: links to interesting things I've found, reviews, thoughts, basically anything that comes to mind. Feel free to take a look. 

## Technical notes

There's not a lot to share in terms of how the new site was created that I haven't already written about on one of the [other]({{< ref "projects/hugo-migration" >}}) [project]({{< ref "projects/nitzanboys-com" >}}) [pages]({{< ref "projects/mt-solitary" >}}) on this site relating to static websites. I chose a very simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme called [hugo-flex](https://github.com/ldeso/hugo-flex) and deployed with Vercel. I added a custom font and a simple GoatCounter script, and the whole thing took me about ten minutes. My fifteen-year-old self writing raw HTML on GeoCities would be amazed.
