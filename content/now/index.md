# Now

*Last updated: January 1, 2025.*

This page contains a quick overview of what I'm doing right now. I try to update it every couple of months. You can see the full history of this page [here](https://github.com/clintonboys/clintonboys.github.io/commits/master/now/index.md). 

## A

## Work

I've been working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) since 2018, doing all sorts of different and interesting stuff, mostly related to algorithms and data science and then building interesting and useful products around these things. Lately I am spending a lot of time on more "core" engineering projects, with a focus on system design, performance, visibility and efficiency at scale.
