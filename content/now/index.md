# Now

*Last updated: April 5, 2025.*

This page, inspired by the now-legendary [post](https://sive.rs/nowff) by Derek Sivers, contains a quick overview of what I'm doing right now. I try to update it every couple of months. 

## Paternity leave

Our third child was born a couple of weeks ago, so I'm currently on paternity leave from at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com), where I have been since 2018. So I am currently in that blissful bubble with a newborn in the house, that is constantly being popped by the chaos of a five- and a two-year old. 

## GreenChainer and Angophora

I've worked on a couple of side projects in the last couple of months, which I have written about in the [projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}) section of this website: [GreenChainer]({{< ref "projects/greenchainer" >}}), a mapping application inspired by the Green Chain walk in South London, and [Angophora]({{< ref "projects/angophora" >}}), a new blog I started this week to share some writing that doesn't naturally fit on this technically-slanted personal website, or on my "digital garden" [Mt. Solitary](https://mtsolitary.com/).
