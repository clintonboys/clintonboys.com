        <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1857244/what-are-the-differences-between-np-np-complete-and-np-hard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NP-hard</a> problems are the most interesting and important class of computational problems. In my experience (and many others&rsquo; I imagine), most hard optimization problems that arise in real applications, and remain interesting enough to keep looking at after an initial investigation, while also being approachable with heuristic methods, are NP-hard.</p>
<p>There are many different and equivalent ways to state NP-hard problems in general. Indeed there is a famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list</a> written by Karp in the early &rsquo;70s of common NP-complete problems that any NP-hard problem can be “reduced to in polynomial time” to any one on the list. This has a precise meaning, but really just means you can just choose your favourite NP-complete problem and pretend that all NP-hard problems are just instances of it, up to some “Karp reduction” that is (at least theoretically) trivial.</p>
<p>One of the problems on this list is “integer linear programming”, and I have always thought this gives the most natural language for formulating and understanding NP-hard problems. Most of the other problems on the list require some additional structure to be present: a graph, usually. But to write out a linear program formulation you just need to decide what your variables are, and write down all the constraints between them. It&rsquo;s very explicit, which can certainly help in the formulation stage when the precise definition of every single constraint in the problem may not be clear.</p>
<p>Which problem from the list you use as the template for your specific problem, when it comes to actually <em>implementing</em> it, may be a different story altogether, one which depends on data structures, available commercial solvers, pre-existing additional structure in the problem, programming language choice and many other things. But I think that in the ideation and formulation stage, it is usually much easier to think about every problem as just a very large integer linear program.</p>
