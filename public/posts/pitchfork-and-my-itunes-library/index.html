    <article class="markdown">
        <p>I listen to a lot of music and for more than a decade now my main source of discovering new music has been <a href="http://www.pitchfork.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitchfork.com</a>, particularly since all my friends only listen to hard trap and hip-hop so getting diverse recommendations from them can be difficult.</p>
<p>Pitchfork is a fairly divisive source of musical recommendations. Some people swear by it; some people hate it. I think Pitchfork is quite a useful source of music discovery, and I think they have some great writers on staff, especially for many of the genres I like. I don&rsquo;t swear by it, and I do try to read other sources for recommendations, but I think my musical tastes are heavily influenced by the website.</p>
<p>I decided to try and quantify exactly how much of my music taste and listening preferences are influenced by Pitchfork.com.</p>
<p>This required me to obtain two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pitchfork review data. Thankfully someone had already scraped this <a href="http://jmduke.com/posts/analysing-pitchfork-using-pandas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (this page is worth a read).</li>
<li>My iTunes library data. I got a new computer quite recently so I unfortunately only have about 18 months of listening data, and I listen to more than half of my music in Spotify now. This should be enough to get an idea of my listening habits however. I used the <a href="https://github.com/liamks/pyitunes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pyiTunes</a> tool to convert the iTunes XML export to a useful Python object.</li>
</ul>
<p>First we look at the average score associated to a Pitchfork review:</p>
<pre><code>reviews = pd.read_csv('reviews.csv')
print np.round(np.mean(reviews['score']),3)

6.974
[Finished in 0.5s]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a pretty high average score! It turns out the artists that I listen to have a higher average score though:</p>
<pre><code>library = Library('Library.xml')
artists_with_plays = []
for id, song in library.songs.items():
    if song.play_count &gt; 0:
        artists_with_plays.append(song.artist)
artists_with_plays=list(set(artists_with_plays))
means = []
for artist in artists_with_plays:
    means.append(np.mean(reviews[reviews['artist']==artist]['score']))
means = [x for x in means if not math.isnan(x)]
print &quot;Average Pitchfork score of artists: &quot; + str(np.round(np.mean(means),3))

Average Pitchfork score of artists: 7.427
[Finished in 16.7s]
</code></pre>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a huge increase; only about 6.5%. Let&rsquo;s work out the average <strong>weighted by play count</strong> now. We change the code a little bit:</p>
<pre><code>def GetMeanRating(artist):
    return np.mean(reviews['score'][reviews['artist']==artist])

artists_with_plays = {}
for id, song in library.songs.items():
    if song.play_count &gt; 0:
        artists_with_plays[song.artist] = artists_with_plays.get(song.artist,0)+song.play_count
means = []
total_plays = 0
for artist in artists_with_plays.keys():
    means.append(GetMeanRating(artist)*artists_with_plays[artist])
    if not math.isnan(GetMeanRating(artist)):
        total_plays = total_plays + artists_with_plays[artist]
means = [x for x in means if not math.isnan(x)]
print &quot;Average play-weighted Pitchfork score of artists: &quot; + str(np.round(np.sum(means)/total_plays,3))

Average play-weighted Pitchfork score of artists: 7.590
[Finished in 16.3s]
</code></pre>
<p>This is an increase of nearly 9% on the review mean. This analysis is a little imperfect because I haven&rsquo;t compensated for the fact that the artist names in the two different datasets may not be the same (for example even if they are capitalised differently they won&rsquo;t match with the code I&rsquo;ve written above). This is a small issue however. I&rsquo;d like to add in my Spotify listening data and old Last.fm data if I get a chance to get a fuller picture of precisely how much of a Pitchfork sycophant I am. I&rsquo;d also like an idea of how my listening habits have changed over time.</p>
