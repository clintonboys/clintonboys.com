        <p>In August 2014, during my transition from studying mathematics in Sydney to working in tech in Tel Aviv, I deployed the first version of my personal website. The site looked pretty similar ten years ago to how it looked yesterday, the main difference being that every post had a photograph at the top, of some different part of the world I had travelled to. These photos were quite nice, and a little differentiating feature from other bland text-based personal websites of tech folks, but at some point around five years ago, I decided to conform to the unwritten international bland text-based personal website standard, and removed the images, justifying it with my desire for a minimalist aesthetic, and improved loading times.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have mostly felt good about this site, but there have been moments when I have not been particularly happy with it. Having a site on the public internet is a real &ldquo;putting yourself out there&rdquo; kind of thing, something that at times feels uncomfortable. Particularly over a period of ten years, there are things I wrote about in the past that I have since learned are wrong, or misguided, or should be done completely differently. It&rsquo;s tempting to delete them - and I have removed a few of the lower quality posts from the site over the years - but I think &ldquo;blemishes and all&rdquo; is the best way to go, as there is value in demonstrating your learning process, of &ldquo;working in public&rdquo;. When I think about it this way, I feel proud of having polished this little corner of the web into something that really feels like it&rsquo;s my own.</p>
<p>I hope I still find myself writing here in another ten years&rsquo; time. I wonder if by then I will have given into the urge to redesign the site using Hugo instead of Jekyll<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which will presumably be ancient technology in 2034 (though there are an awful lot of PHP sites still up and running today, so who knows).</p>
<p>And for now I have brought the images back. Life is too short, and the internet is too precious a thing, to not add a little bit of colour when you can. Who else are these little corners of the web we build for, after all?</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t resist the urge to do a bit of a cleanup, fix a bunch of hardcoded things and unncessary cruft in the repository, upgrade some packages, and move the deployment to Vercel from Github Pages - I have been using Vercel for my <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital garden</a> for a few years and it&rsquo;s really nice.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
