    <article class="markdown">
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a system of organising my notes, which represent a sort of &ldquo;second brain&rdquo; for my thoughts, for many years. I have thousands of text files on my computer, containing all sorts of to-do lists, journal snippets, ideas, things I&rsquo;ve learned and half-started projects that have moved between different platforms looking for a way to become a single system. I&rsquo;ve tried simply using Apple Notes and its built-in search. I have extensively used and eventually given up on Evernote. I tried Notion seriously for a while: it&rsquo;s a really great idea but eventually I just couldn&rsquo;t live with the privacy concerns (your data lives unencrypted on someone else&rsquo;s server) and the Electron UI (ditto Typora). I tried Things, which is also a really great app, but something never clicked there for me and the notetaking functionality always seemed lacking. Lately I&rsquo;ve been using iAWriter, a truly fantastic writing app for Mac and iOS. I tried Bear. I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic about Agenda. But all of these systems have had extensive lists of shortcomings, or only do one thing well, and I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of being able to find something that does everything exactly the way I want it to, which can be customised and changed to fit me and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Let me make it a bit clearer what exactly I&rsquo;ve been looking for before I explain over a series of posts how I&rsquo;m using the venerable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emacs</a> and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org_mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">org mode</a> to implement a solution to pretty much all of my requirements, in a way that is based entirely on plain text and fully customisable, open-source tools. I&rsquo;m looking for an organisation and notetaking system which</p>
<ul>
<li>provides a comfortable, reliable, fast, attractive and well-designed way of writing plain text files (usually I write in Markdown, a markup language that is popular and easily transportable across different applications);</li>
<li>has a heirarchical system of organising files and folders with notes and links;</li>
<li>provides a way to keep track of projects, to-do lists, recurring tasks and reminders;</li>
<li>works entirely or almost entirely with the keyboard;</li>
<li>is customisable and adaptable, including scripting and automation; and</li>
<li>is exportable to formats like PDF and HTML so I can use it directly to write reports and documents meant for others to read.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation"></h>Installation<a href="#installation">
    
  </a>
</h3><p>Like a lot of people who are first taking the plunge into emacs, I tried <a href="">Spacemacs</a> for a few days; it&rsquo;s a prepackaged version of emacs with a bunch of additional packages and extensions installed, in particular a slightly different UI and key commands based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vi_%28text_editor%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vi</a>. I struggled with it: it was slow and felt bloated and convoluted and eventually decided I wanted to learn how everything works from scratch so removed it from my system and installed a clean, &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; version of GNU Emacs. Installing on my Mac (macOS 10.15 Catalina) was as simple as</p>


  <pre><code>brew cask install emacs</code></pre>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already tried Spacemacs, removing it and replacing it with a vanilla version is a little trickier than this, because Spacemacs isn&rsquo;t really a replacement application, rather a series of configuration files on top of a regular emacs install. It&rsquo;s usually enough to just delete all the configuration files that Spacemacs creates on install in <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and recreate the Applications icon. If you&rsquo;re at all serious about using emacs long-term, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s definitely worth spending a little bit of time setting things up the way you like them instead of trying to bend Spacemacs to your will.</p>
<p>You should end up when you start up the program you just installed with a very ancient-looking and plain text editor:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/emacs_blank.png"
	alt="Vanilla emacs" 
	class="single-post-image" 
	loading="lazy"
	decoding="async"
	></p>
<p>At this point, the emacs editor is technically installed but we will need to do some extensive configuration and customisation to get it looking and performing like a modern text editor. It&rsquo;s worth at this point at least understanding the basics of how it works.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-emacs"></h>How to use emacs<a href="#how-to-use-emacs">
    
  </a>
</h3><p>Emacs commands are entered with the keyboard and you should almost never need to use the mouse for anything. If this sounds weird to you, stick with it for a while and you&rsquo;ll realise how much faster it is and why you never want to reach for the mouse if you don&rsquo;t absolutely have to. <code>C-</code> stands for &ldquo;hold the control key while pressing&rdquo;, so for example the command to open a new file is <code>C-x C-f</code>; hold control and press x, and then press f (with control still held down). You will then be prompted to enter a filename; if the file exists, emacs will open it, otherwise it will create a new file. Create a new file in <code>~/Desktop/emacs_test.txt</code> and press <code>RET</code> (the enter key).</p>
<p>This file then opens in a <em>buffer</em>. A buffer is a chunk of text that you&rsquo;re currently editing. You can save the contents of a buffer to a file. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do now: type something using the keyboard, and then press <code>C-x C-s</code> to save the contents of this buffer to the file.</p>
<p>You can spend some time now during the emacs tutorial; type <code>C-h t</code> to start the built-in emacs tutorial which explains basics like how to navigate with the keyboard, how to cut and paste (emacs is so old it predates the usual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->⌘-C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->⌘-V<!-- raw HTML omitted --> commands for cut and paste; it has a slightly different concept of &ldquo;killing&rdquo; and &ldquo;yanking&rdquo; that takes a little while to get used to) and other common tasks. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s 100% necessary to go through this now; it&rsquo;s a lot to learn and remember and these are the sort of things you can always figure out as you go along. It&rsquo;s also a lot nicer to configure the UI a little first so you can do the tutorial in a text editor that looks like it&rsquo;s from this millenium.</p>
<h3 id="customisation-and-configuration"></h>Customisation and configuration<a href="#customisation-and-configuration">
    
  </a>
</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you&rsquo;re extremely dissatisifed with the default appearance above and want, among other things</p>
<ul>
<li>dark mode (everything has a dark mode now so white backgrounds hurt my eyes and my brain)</li>
<li>a more attractive fixed width font</li>
<li>just in general a slightly less 1970s Linux look-and-feel</li>
<li>syntax highlighting for various file formats (most importantly .md and .py)</li>
<li>an informative and useful status bar at the bottom</li>
</ul>
<p>After some customisation and configuration, we&rsquo;ll set up emacs to look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/emacs_full.png"
	alt="Vanilla emacs" 
	class="single-post-image" 
	loading="lazy"
	decoding="async"
	></p>
<p>Configuring emacs is quite simple. All the customisation is defined in a file located at <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>; if you open this file now (in emacs!) you will notice it&rsquo;s empty; this means we are using the default emacs installation. We&rsquo;re now going to add a bunch of different text to this file: actually we&rsquo;re writing lines of code in emacs Lisp, to get the customisations we want.</p>
<h4 id="font-and-theme"></h>Font and theme<a href="#font-and-theme">
    
  </a>
</h4><p>I took a bunch of my original UI configuration from <a href="https://dev.to/huytd/emacs-from-scratch-1cg6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huy Tr.</a>.</p>
<h4 id="icon"></h>Icon<a href="#icon">
    
  </a>
</h4><p>Again, if you&rsquo;re anything like me (and I guess if you&rsquo;ve read this far into my emacs setup you probably are), the first thing that will strike you as ugly and in desperate need of replacement is the dock icon. I guess I wasn&rsquo;t the first person to think this; I pulled a new icon from <a href="https://emacs.sexy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emacs is sexy</a>, and replaced it according to the instructions <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/229524/how-do-i-change-the-icon-of-emacs-installed-via-homebrew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="minimal-ui"></h>Minimal UI<a href="#minimal-ui">
    
  </a>
</h4><p>I am removing parts of the UI I don&rsquo;t find particularly useful (since I interact entirely through the keyboard). The first few lines of my <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> are:</p>
<pre><code>(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode   -1)
(tooltip-mode    -1)
(menu-bar-mode   -1)
</code></pre>
<p>Open your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file, add those lines, save the file and reload it with <code>M-x load-file ~/.emacs.d/init.el RET</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom</a> theme <code>doom-one</code>. I use dark themes pretty much wherever I can: MacOS Mojave, iOS 13, and this is a great dark mode theme for emacs. In the two modes that I write in the most, Markdown and Org mode, I like bright colourful syntax highlighting; for Org mode I actually use a custom series of colours for headings that I chose myself:</p>
<pre><code>(custom-theme-set-faces 'user '(org-level-1 ((t (:foreground &quot;#BF9D7A&quot;))))) ;;D8A47F 
(custom-theme-set-faces 'user '(org-level-2 ((t (:foreground &quot;#D4DCA9&quot;))))) ;;EF8354 
(custom-theme-set-faces 'user '(org-level-3 ((t (:foreground &quot;#EBF2EA&quot;))))) ;;EE4B6A 
(custom-theme-set-faces 'user '(org-level-4 ((t (:foreground &quot;#0ABDA0&quot;))))) ;;DF3B57 
(custom-theme-set-faces 'user '(org-level-5 ((t (:foreground &quot;#80ADD7&quot;))))) ;;0F7173
</code></pre>
<p>These make the headings look nice and contrast well against the grey background.</p>
<p>In future posts I will further detail my emacs setup, including how I use org-mode to implement most of the note-taking requirements I mentioned at the top.</p>
