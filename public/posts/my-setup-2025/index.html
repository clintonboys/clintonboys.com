</h1><p><em>January 2025</em></p>
<p>In this post I answer the interview questions from <a href="http://usesthis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uses this</a> - again. This is an updated version of <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/my-setup-2021/">this post</a> which I wrote in 2021, and is now the fifth time I have answered these questions. I have enjoyed reading <em>uses this</em> for many years and I like having a little archive of my own setups - you can see the five times I have done this exercise here.</p>

</h2><p>I&rsquo;m an Australian mathematician and software engineer living in London. I&rsquo;m currently working at <a href="https://ridewithvia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Via</a>. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, writing, listening to and making music, and spending time with my family.</p>
<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use"></h>What hardware do you use?<a href="#what-hardware-do-you-use">
    
  </a>
</h2><p>I have two 14&quot; MacBook Pros from 2021 with the M1 Pro &ldquo;Apple Silicon&rdquo; processor - one from work, and one for my personal use. I never mix the two, never sign into personal accounts (iCloud, email, whatever) on my work computer, and vice versa. The M1 MacBook Pro is definitely the best computer I&rsquo;ve ever owned - I wrote up a bit more about why I love it <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/20220328150308-m1_pro_macbook_pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. At my desk at home, I have my work computer hooked up to a 27&quot; Lenovo monitor, and my personal computer to the side for playing music through a Behringer UR-22 audio interface and some cheap but decent Samson BT3 studio monitors, which I also use in my spare time to record music, when I get the chance. My recording setup is simple: alongside the UR-22 I use Shure SM58 and 57 microphones and a Yamaha P-121 digital piano. It&rsquo;s a basic setup but it works for the basic stuff I do.</p>

<p>Also on my desk is my trusty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAS</a> - a Synology server with lots of storage which functions as a backup and media server for my household.</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 14 Pro, which I use to take all my photos these days (though many of the older photos on this site were taken with an Olympus E-PM1). An 11&quot; iPad Air gets used when I&rsquo;m making and recording music, or for video calls to relatives in far-away lands. I listen to music through AirPods Pro, which I also have in my ears most of the day for remote meetings at work. My home stereo which gets a lot of use is a half-decent Sonyo receiver hooked up to some Wharfedale speakers, a fairly basic record player and an Apple TV. I also have an Apple Watch.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-software"></h>And what software?<a href="#and-what-software">
    
  </a>
</h2><p>I use <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-started-with-emacs/">emacs</a> to edit almost all of my text files, which is the majority of what I do with my personal computer these days (writing code is also editing text files). I use org mode and org agenda to manage all my tasks, to dos and notes, with the excellent Beorg app on iOS to handle everything through my phone. See <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/20210309194647-my-org-mode-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for a detailed write-up about my org-mode setup. All my files and photos are backed up at least three times - you can read about my backup solution <a href="https://www.mtsolitary.com/20230507063159-backups_public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>I browse the web in Safari and listen to music in Apple Music, where I have a huge amount of custom playlists I&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into and am very happy with. For recording music I use Logic Pro.</p>
<p>I also use a bunch of utilities to keep my computer sane: f.lux so my eyes don&rsquo;t get burnt out, Alfred to launch applications, Divvy to move windows around using keyboard commands and mclock to keep two time zones in my menu bar.</p>
<p>On my phone, apart from the obvious stuff like Messages, Whatsapp (ugh), Mail, Photos, Telegram and Phone, my homescreen consists of Calendar, Music, a bunch of navigation apps, Safari, Files, beorg for my todo lists and tasks, and iAWriter for editing Markdown on the go. I deleted all my social media accounts years ago.</p>

</h2><p>This has been the same since I first wrote it in 2015. An infinitely fast and thin laptop computer, with infinite battery and high-speed internet access everywhere. Perfectly comfortable headphones I can wear all day, and a completely lossless music collection. Apart from that I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how things are at the moment: slowly but surely getting better, just like me.</p>
