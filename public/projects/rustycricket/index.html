  </a>
</h1><p><em>October 10, 2023</em></p>
<p>Here is a strategy for time-poor working parents who are trying to learn new things: try to learn two new things at once. That&rsquo;s what I did recently when trying to pick up a bit of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</a>. For the uninitiated, Rust is a fairly new, relatively low-level &ldquo;systems programming&rdquo; language with an emphasis on speed and safety. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn Rust for a while, and have been looking for a side project that could work as an excuse.</p>
<p>In my experience the <em>subject</em> of a side project, if you want it to be successful and to actually have a chance of finishing it or learning something from it, needs to be something you are passionately interested in (even if the passion is fleeting). I have lots of posts on this site with details about side projects related to my interests: [elections]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-01-25-aus-election-model-7.md %}), [music]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-03-30-itunes-and-pitchfork.md %}), [politics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-12-21-uk-av-sim.md %}), [emacs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-05-20-emacs-i.md %}), [mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-09-01-kepler.md %}). So for this project I chose another interest: cricket.</p>
<p>And here comes the second thing I wanted to learn: the ECS (Entity Component System) programming paradigm, commonly used in game development. So the project comes into shape: use Rust, and an ECS framework, to build a cricket simulator. Sounds like fun!</p>
<p>Initially I had thought to just build out a scoreboard that updates as you click through the deliveries of the game. This would definitely give me enough to work on, learning how to set up all the entities I need, the components, the systems that update the scoreboard. But I figured it would be a little boring to look at, so decided in the end to make a visualisation of the ground and even animate the ball being bowled, hit and fielded.</p>
<p>To do all of this, I used <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rltk</a>, a game engine for Rust, originally designed for &ldquo;Roguelikes&rdquo;, a type of retro computer game with procedurally generated graphics and a &ldquo;dungeon crawl&rdquo; RPG mechanic. rltk provides a lot of very helpful structures to get you up and running; I just render a simple black square and use ASCII art to fill out my field, players, pitch, stumps and scoreboard.</p>

<p>At first I just hardcoded to make sure it rendered correctly. Then I set about replacing all of the things you see in the image above with <em>entities</em>, <em>components</em> and <em>systems</em> according to the ECS paradigm.</p>
<p>For example, there is a <code>DisplayGlyph</code> component which contains the information required to display the correct symbol for a player (batsman, bowler, fielder, keeper, umpire). Then there&rsquo;s the <code>Position</code> component which describes where on the map to render the symbol. If you then insert an entity into the game, and populate it with components, you can define a <code>display_system</code> to make sure the glyphs are rendered in their correct positions every loop.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have <code>bowling_system</code>, <code>batting_system</code>, <code>fielding_system</code> which moves everything around the map according to logic, alongside the <code>scoreboard_system</code> which updates the scoreboard and the <code>match_system</code> which determines the ultimate winning logic and ends the game.</p>

          <td style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 2: Through midwicket for 1 run.</em></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Overall this exercise was really fun and it taught me a lot about game development, ECS and in particular Rust. Rust feels really well suited to building games: its neat &ldquo;structs&rdquo;, cruel but fair type system and ingenious borrow checker are all very useful when you are writing code that needs to be performant and run every click. Writing a game also makes you think a lot harder about the loops you write, about data structures and memory and CPU efficiency. I enjoyed it a lot.</p>
