  </a>
</h1><p><em>June 6, 2024</em></p>
<p>This project tries to simulate what the latest Israeli election would have been like under a single-member electorate system. If we use a &ldquo;first-past-the-post&rdquo; element in each electorate, we end up with a system very similar to the system that chooses the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; since we want to retain the current size of the Knesset, we assume 120 constituencies, which we explicitly create on the map using data from the Knesset and census websites. We are going to be using three data sources in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/Documents/statisticalareas_2020_demography.gdb.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistical areas</a>. A list of &ldquo;statistical areas&rdquo;, which are the smallest districts that the Israeli government collects high-level demographic data on, and for which there is an accompanying shapefile available on the Israeli statistics bureau <a href="https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/Pages/geo-layers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>. There are 3187 of these areas around the country. These statistical areas do not include many settlements in the West Bank, but do include the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem, and several of the large settlement blocs.</li>
<li><a href="https://media22.bechirot.gov.il/files/expb.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Votes</a> by polling place. A table of votes for each of the 39 &ldquo;ptakim&rdquo;, or symbols representing party tickets in the elections for the 24th Knesset in March 2021, aggregated by &ldquo;kalpi&rdquo;, or polling place. There are over 12,000 of these around the country, including all around the West Bank, in all the settlements where Israeli citizens live. This data is available from the Knesset&rsquo;s <a href="https://votes22.bechirot.gov.il/cityresults" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://bechirot24.bechirot.gov.il/election/Kneset24/Documents/%d7%9b%d7%a0%d7%a1%d7%aa%2024/statistic_report_tofes_b_15_3_21.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Addresses</a> of polling places. A list of all the polling places and their physical address, in Hebrew. This is also available from the Knesset&rsquo;s <a href="https://bechirot24.bechirot.gov.il/election/Kneset24/Pages/BallotsList.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="statistical-areas"></h>Statistical areas<a href="#statistical-areas">
    
  </a>
</h3><p>We read the file containing the &ldquo;layer&rdquo; of the statistical areas. This is a Geodatabase file containing geometric information about each area, stored as a polygon in the <code>geometry</code> column, some metadata about each area, and demographic statistics (breakdowns by gender and age, and whether the area is populated by Jews or not). Of the demographic data, we only require the total population column for this project, to allow us to cluster statistical areas together into electorates, so we only select the metadata, the total population and the geometry.</p>
<p>We plot these areas coloured by the population column just to check we are onto something.</p>

<h3 id="polling-place-locations"></h>Polling place locations<a href="#polling-place-locations">
    
  </a>
</h3><p>The data from the Knesset website gives addresses (in Hebrew) for each polling place. We are going to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geocoding</a> API to get the latitude and longitude coordinates of each polling place. This will allow us to associate each polling place to a unique statistical area.</p>
<p>I first tried using <a href="https://developer.here.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> for the geocoding API. It actually took some searching to find something that worked well in Hebrew, was decently accurate, free and not Google. I got what seemed like pretty decent results with this free API, with the geocoding succeeding 84% of the time. Note that&rsquo;s still almost seven hundred addresses I would need to encode manually (or with a better API) however.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the data, and noticed much of it was completely wrong. At first I used just the address and town fields to build the address; with this I managed to tag 84% of the polling places. When I added the &ldquo;location&rdquo; field as well, I actually got worse results, I guess because I was confusing the API.</p>
<p>So in the end, with my tail between my legs, I signed up for Google Cloud Platform and used about 30 of my 300 USD credits doing the geocoding through the best geocoding API money can buy. You really cannot come close to Google and it&rsquo;s a bit scary how good they are. I got 97.2% of the addresses coded, leaving me with only 122 to encode manually.</p>

<p>This map has a lot of holes, and it&rsquo;s because of this:</p>
<pre><code>: Statistical areas: 3187.\nStatistical areas with no polling place: 2232

<p>There are 955 &ldquo;statistical areas&rdquo; without a single polling place inside. These areas are presumably unsettled. Again, note also most of the West Bank polling places are not in statistical areas.</p>

</h3><p>Our next task is to create 120 electorates. I want to do this by creating 120 electorates of roughly equal population by combining statistical areas together. I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about it, but when I started thinking about how to implement this and researching stuff online, I pretty soon realised that this is exactly how actual electoral districts are drawn up in countries that have them, and there is quite a large body of research into this interesting and difficult problem.</p>
<p>I found quite a lot of papers on this topic, and decided to implement one of them for this project.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-some-districting-algorithms"></h>Implementing some districting algorithms<a href="#implementing-some-districting-algorithms">
    
  </a>
</h3><p>We are going to be using the following method from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03358.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cohen-Addad et al</a>&rsquo;s paper (p12):</p>
<h4 id="computing-a-balanced-centroidal-power-diagram-for-p"></h>Computing a balanced centroidal power diagram for $P$<a href="#computing-a-balanced-centroidal-power-diagram-for-p">
    
  </a>
</h4><p>A balanced centroidal power diagram is an augmented power diagram $P(C,w,f)$ such that $f$ is both balanced and centroidal. We implement the following capacitated variant of Lloyd’s method to compute such a diagram, given $P$ and the desired number $k$ of centers. Starting with a sequence $C$ of $k$ randomly chosen centers, repeat the following steps until Step (2) doesn’t change C:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given $C$, compute a minimum-cost balanced assignment $f: P \to C$.</li>
<li>Move each center $x\in C$ to the centroid of the residents that $f$ assigns to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each iteration except the last reduces the cost, $\sum_{y\in P} d^2(y,f(y))$, and at termination, the pair $(C,f)$ is a local minimum in the following sense: by just moving the centers in $C$, or just changing $f$ (while respecting the balance constraint), it is not possible to reduce the cost.</p>
<p>We solve the problem in Step (1) by reducing it to minimum-cost flow; yielding both the stipulated f and (via the dual variables) weights $w$ such that $P(C,w,f)$ is a balanced power diagram. Note that the solution obtained by minimum-cost flow assigns assigns each person to a single district. In the last iteration, Step (2) does not change $C$, so $f$ is also centroidal, and at termination $P(C,w,f)$ is a balanced centroidal power diagram, as desired.</p>
<p>So our steps will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>create an initial random collection of centres
<ul>
<li>create a polygon for the whole of Israel</li>
<li>randomly choose 120 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>implement the MCF balanced assignment optimizer</li>
<li>implement the iteration</li>
</ul>

<p>But after I went through the paper again I realised the whole point of the first &ldquo;phase&rdquo; of their algorithm is that you allow census blocks to be split, so you need LP variables for each of the population. So probably I need to use a MCF implementation; I would like to try OR-tools at first.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t completely get to finish this project, but the above picture gives the basic idea, it&rsquo;s just missing the final &ldquo;contiguity&rdquo; constraint which is harder to encode. I didn&rsquo;t get around to this yet, but if someone else would like to pick up from here I would be very keen to see a final map!</p>
